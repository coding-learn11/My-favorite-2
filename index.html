        <p> My favorite hobby is to play games. I like playing games because they are fun and you can play them anywhere you would like to as long as if you have internet. I usually play games after school or during breaks. I like to play roleplay and obby games as they are fun. Some games that I play are Adopt Me!, Tower of Hell, and Royale High. These games include roleplays, obbies, and interacting with other online players.</p>
